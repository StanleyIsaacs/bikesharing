## Analysis:
### Looking at our data, most of the rides are taking place during traditional rush hour leading me to believe customers are using the service as an alternative to public transport. On the weekends when checkout time is longer, most of the rides are concentrated in Manhattan leading us to believe tourists are taking part in Citi Bike. These facts are important because we can now look at Des Moines to see how dependent citizens are on public transport. In NYC this clearly fills a need but if people don't use public transport/ have their own cars, there may not me a market for Citi Bike. Additionally, if the folks using Citi Bike for tourist activites, does that market even exist in Des Moines. Are there enough tourists who'd like to bike around to make starting Citi Bike in Des Moines feasable.For future and further anaylis I would recommend looking at each month. Do customers drop of in the cold months/ pile on in the mild spring times? I would then suggest looking at the average temperature by month in Des Moines to see if there is enough rideable time during the year fo the bikes to make sense.
